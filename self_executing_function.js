// self executing anonymous function and functional programming 
// self executing function is slightly different from regular function
// in this function it has no name and there is no required of any function call its executed by own self

// syntax: (function(){statement}) ();

(function(){
    console.log("say hello");
    console.log("soitan motu");
}) ();                // but its no uses so much
